2 APIs:
    Program to RPi GPIO
    Program to Frontend

P -> RPi
    if alarm time = current time {
        // make alarm ring for max 1 hours without snooze so that it doesn't ring forever
        int t = 3600
        while (t >= 0) {
            set gpio pin 17 to high
            wait(3)
            set gpio pin 17 low
            wait(2)
            t -= 5
        } // 5 second loop, might record what my alarm does and modify this to match it
    }

    // How complex do we make these alarms? Do we want to set times like Alarm A only goes off on Monday through Friday?
    // I don't see why flutter wouldn't have a day by day widget.
    // M T W R F S (Sunday is unnecessary)


P -> Frontend
    I'm pretty sure all we have to do is static file 
    hosting, but I could be wrong...

    We still need a way to tell the RPi to create/delete/enable/disable an alarm to watch for from the front end though, and also snoozing/stopping the alarm.
    So, like websockets and shit idk
